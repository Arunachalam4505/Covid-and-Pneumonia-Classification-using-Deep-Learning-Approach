# Covid-and-Pneumonia-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-Approach

Recent studies indicate that detecting radiographic patters on X-rays and scans can yield high sensitivity and specificity for COVID 19 identification. Especially, during pandemic crisis, there is need to scan patients a quickly and accurately. Deep learning approaches are widely used in the medical community. However, they require large datasets. In this work, we have experimental setup which uses various deep learning techniques including convolution neural networks, transfer learning and few shot learning. A novel method of few-shot learning using Siamese networks for chest X-rays has been implemented and various paradigm of transfer learning metrics are observed. The results show that transfer learning and few-shot learning can be used to train and test different models accurately with less amount of data.
